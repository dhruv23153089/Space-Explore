                <h3>Chandrayaan-3 Mission</h3>
                <p>Chandrayaan-3 is India's third lunar mission and second attempt at achieving a soft landing on the moon's surface. The mission aims to demonstrate safe and soft lunar landing, rover mobility, and in-situ scientific experiments. It consists of a three-component mission: a Propulsion Module, a Lander Module, and a Rover Module.</p>

                <h3>ADITYA-L1</h3>
                <p>Aditya-L1 is a coronagraphy spacecraft for studying the solar atmosphere, designed and developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and various other Indian Space Research Institutes. It is orbiting at about 1.5 million km from Earth in a halo orbit around the Lagrange point 1 (L1) between the Earth and the Sun.</p>

                <h3>Vikram Lander</h3>
                <p>The Vikram lander of the Chandrayaan-2 mission was named after Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, the father of India's space program. Vikram was designed to operate for one lunar day, about 14 Earth days, and was responsible for soft landing on the Moon. It carried scientific instruments to perform on-site analysis. Although the initial landing attempt failed, NASA has since confirmed that Vikram remains on the lunar surface and will serve as a long-term location marker, benefiting future lunar missions.</p>

                 <h3>Possible Volcanic Moon detected 635 light-years away</h3>
                 <p>The existence of exomoons (moons around planets outside our solar system) has long been theorized. A new NASA-led study, however, suggests that a potential exomoon may be orbiting the exoplanet WASP-49 b, a gas giant located 635 light-years from Earth. The possible exomoon is believed to be rocky and volcanically active.</p>
