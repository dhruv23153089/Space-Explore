       <p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is India's national space agency, renowned for its advancements in space technology and exploration. Here's a brief history of ISRO:</p>
       <h4>Founding and Early Years</h4>
       <ul>
        <li><strong><b>1962: </b></strong> The space program in India began with the establishment of the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) under Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, often regarded as the father of the Indian space program.</li>
        <li><strong><b>1969: </b></strong> INCOSPAR evolved into the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on August 15, 1969, under the Department of Atomic Energy.</li>
        <li><strong><b>1972: </b></strong> The Department of Space (DoS) was established, and ISRO came under its administration.</li>
       </ul>

       <h4>Key Milestones in ISRO’s Journey</h4>
       <ul>
        <h4>1970s: Initial Experiments</h4>
        <li><strong>Aryabhata (1975): </strong>India's first satellite, launched by the Soviet Union. This marked India's entry into space.</li>
        <li><strong>Bhaskara Satellites (1979-1981): </strong>Launched for remote sensing purposes, focusing on earth observation.</li>

        <h4>1980s: Indigenous Launch Vehicle Development</h4>
        <li><strong>SLV-3 (1980): </strong>India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle successfully launched Rohini satellite into orbit.</li>
        <li><strong>ASLV Program: </strong>Advanced Satellite Launch Vehicle developed for heavier payloads.</li>
       
        <h4>1990s: Operational Satellite Systems</h4>
        <li><strong>PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle): </strong>Became ISRO’s workhorse, launching satellites for remote sensing, communications, and interplanetary missions.</li>
        <li><strong>GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle): </strong>Developed for heavier payloads and geostationary orbits.</li>
       
        <h4>2000s: Global Recognition</h4>
        <li><strong>Chandrayaan-1 (2008): </strong>India’s first lunar mission, which discovered water molecules on the moon's surface.</li>
        <li><strong>Cartosat and INSAT Satellites: </strong>Advanced capabilities in weather forecasting, communication, and mapping.</li>

        <h4>2010s: Mars and Beyond</h4>
        <li><strong>Mangalyaan (2013): </strong>Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), India became the first country to succeed in its maiden Mars mission, and at the lowest cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Chandrayaan-2 (2019): </strong>A lunar mission aimed at studying the moon’s south pole; while the lander didn’t succeed, the orbiter continues to send valuable data.</li>

        <h4>2020s: Lunar Triumph and Future Plans</h4>
        <li><strong>Chandrayaan-3 (2023): </strong>Achieved a historic soft landing near the moon’s south pole, making India the first country to reach this region successfully.</li>
        <li><strong>Aditya-L1 (2023): </strong>India’s first solar observation mission to study the Sun's atmosphere and dynamics.</li>
       </ul>

       <h4>Key Contributions of ISRO</h4>
       <ol>
        <li><strong>Satellite Programs: </strong>India has a robust fleet of satellites for communication, navigation (NavIC), earth observation, and weather forecasting.</li>
        <li><strong>Launch Vehicle Development: </strong>ISRO’s PSLV and GSLV series have achieved global recognition for cost-effective satellite launches.</li>
        <li><strong>Space Exploration: </strong>Missions to the moon (Chandrayaan), Mars (Mangalyaan), and upcoming interplanetary missions demonstrate India’s scientific prowess.</li>
        <li><strong>Global Satellite Launch Services: </strong>ISRO has launched over 400 foreign satellites for various countries.</li>
        <li><strong>Societal Applications: </strong>Satellite technology has been effectively used for education, healthcare, disaster management, and rural development.</li>
       </ol>

       <h4>Future Aspirations</h4>
       <ol>
        <li><strong>Gaganyaan: </strong>India’s first human spaceflight mission.</li>
        <li><strong>Lunar and Interplanetary Missions: </strong>Chandrayaan-4 and Venus exploration missions are in development.</li>
        <li><strong>Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLV): </strong>Working on reducing launch costs further with RLV technology.</li>
        <li><strong>Space Station: </strong>Plans to establish an Indian space station by 2030.</li>
       </ol>
